Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Sequencing of Osteosarcoma 

This project involves comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analyses of osteosarcoma, a malignant bone tumor. The goal is to understand the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization within the tumor microenvironment.
